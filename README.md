### Getting Started:
To get started with the Chat App:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. In one terminal, run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. In another terminal, run the Convex server: `npx convex dev`
5. Now you're ready to start chatting! Visit the specified localhost address in your browser to access the application.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend and Database:** Convex
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **File Upload:** Edge Store

### Methodology:
My development methodology focused on efficiency, scalability, and user experience. I followed a meticulous process to select technologies, libraries, and frameworks based on specific criteria:

1. **Efficiency:** I prioritized technologies known for their performance and efficiency to ensure a smooth user experience, even under heavy load.
   
2. **Scalability:** My selection criteria included the ability of technologies to scale seamlessly as the user base grows, allowing for future expansion without major rearchitecting.
   
3. **User Experience:** Technologies were chosen with a focus on enhancing the user experience, offering features like real-time communication, seamless authentication, and secure file sharing.

My methodology involved extensive research into various options available for each aspect of the project, including frontend, backend, authentication, and file handling. I evaluated each technology based on its features, community support, documentation, and alignment with my project requirements.

By carefully considering these factors, I ensured that the chosen technologies, libraries, and frameworks not only met my current needs but also provided a solid foundation for future iterations and enhancements of the chat app.
